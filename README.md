Started of as an ELRO Community project, the purpose of the APP is to explore ways for citizen scientist to contribute to the development of a shoreline park. In a shoreline park scientist would want to know how their park is impacting the ecological enviroment. This app will help track animal sightings in the park while providing a fun activity for the visitor.

What can it do:
* Classify the sighted animal.
* Display information of the animal to the user.
* Create a form for the user to submit their sighting and contribute to a database for the park agents.

Of course, there are already apps that can do this but we were trying to learn and develope something fun and intresting ourselves.

A list of resources we used to learn are listed in the acknowledgements.
